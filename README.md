# image-classification-ML-SSVM
A machine learning program in Java that makes binary classifications of images. The ML algorithm used is a variant of the Support Vector Machine algo, a simplified version that was designed to be more palatable for novice programming students. This program is being revised to be a multi-class machine learning program.
